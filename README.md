### Installing

A few steps:

* Create a slack app, call it `Dungeon Master` or whatever you want
* Under `Basic Information` you `Add features and functionality`
	* Add a bot
	* Add Event Subscriptions to `app_mention`, `message.channels`, and `message.groups` (for this, you'll need a URL, which you can get around and run locally by using `ngrok.io`)
	* add permissions
